The file is a gzipped tar. gzip and tar are available from

See the file ncurses-1.8.7/INSTALL for instructions on how to build

ncurses is a SYSV-compatible curses (screen management) package.
It supports keypad() allowing access to function and arrow keys.
It supports and uses Terminfo instead of termcap for terminal description.
It has support for PC graphic characters (used in drawing boxes).
It has color support similar to that in SYSV curses.

It currently has support for the following:
Linux
386BSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD
BSDI's BSD/386
SYSTEM V R4
SunOs 4.1.3
Ultrix
HP/UX 9.0
HP/UX with c89 compiler
Apollo
NeXTSTEP 3.0
NeXTSTEP 3.2
AIX 3.2.5
Some people are working on A/UX, SCO, DEC alpha, SunOs with glibc.

Any comments, bug reports, patches, additions are welcome.
If you have a program that's having problems running with ncurses either send
me a copy of it or tell where I can get a copy.

========================== CHANGES  & NOTES ==============================

Yes, there was an 1.8.6 but only a few people had access to (or knowledge of)
it. Thanks to their feedback 1.8.7 is a better ncurses!

*) untic on longer exists, infocmp replaces it.
*) tic can understand termcap now, especially if it is called captoinfo.
*) The Linux Standard Console terminfo entry is called linux insead of console.
   You HAVE to modify /etc/termcap, /etc/profile, /etc/ttytype, etc.
   accordingly. It also uses the kernel's new method of changing charsets.
*) initscr() will EXIT upon error (as the docs say) This wil mostly happen if
   you try to run on an undefined terminal.
*) I can get things running on AIX but tic can't compile terminfo. I have to
   compile entries on another machine. Volunteers to hunt this bug are welcome.
*) wbkgd() and wbkgdset() can be used to set a windows background to color.
   wclear()/werase() DO NOT use the current attribute to clear the screen.
   This is the way SVR4 curses works. PDCurses is broken with this respect.
*) cleaned up the test/ directory.    
*) test/worm will segfault after for quite a while.
*) many spelling corrections courtesy of Thomas E. Dickey
