# Most commercial systems don't bother to declare external variables in their headers
# If your system is one of those, use -DBRAINDEAD

# BSD systems (386bsd, BSDI, and probably others) don't have TAB3
# or XTABS. Some systems have TAB3 but not XTABS.
# HPux doesn't need this flag.

# use -DBSDTABS if your system doesn't have TAB3 in termios.h
# TABS = -DBSDTABS

# If your OS integrator didn't install a terminfo database,
# use -DTERMCAP_FILE=/etc/termcap to compile runtime support
# for reading and translating capabilities from the termcap
# database.  This is a kluge; it will bulk up and slow down
# every program that uses ncurses, and translated termcap
# entries cannot use full terminfo capabilities.  Don't use
# it unless you absolutely have to; instead, get your system
# people to run tic(1) from root on the existing termcap file
# to translate it into a terminfo database.
