		README file for the ncurses package

DOCUMENTATION:

See the file ANNOUNCE for a summary of ncurses features and ports.
See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install ncurses.
See the file CHANGES for a release history and bug-fix notes.

Detailed documentation can be found in the man directory.  An HTML
introduction to ncurses programming lives in the doc directory.

RELATED RESOURCES:

This distribution now includes (and uses) a copy of the master terminfo
database maintained by Eric Raymond.  This database (which is the 
official descendant of the 4.4BSD termcap file) changes faster than this
code does.

You can surf to a WWW page that carries the current terminfo master file,
and news about ncurses, at

	http://www.ccil.org/~esr/ncurses.html
