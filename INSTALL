             How to install Ncurses/Terminfo on your system 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
************************************************************
* READ ALL OF THIS FILE BEFORE YOU TRY AND INSTALL NCURSES.*
************************************************************

You should be reading the file INSTALL in a directory called:
ncurses-1.8.6
There are several subdirectories, called 'src', 'test', 'data',
and 'man'.

You NEED the following in order to build and install ncurses:
gcc or other ANSI C compiler
sh (bash will do)
awk
sed
BSD style install

1.  It is an unfortunate fact of life that your have to configure things
    differently on different operating system. OS and setup configuration
    is done in a file called Config.<os-name> in the src directory.
    These file are generated automatically when you run the src/Configure
    script, and so is the appropriate makefile.
    If your operating system is not supported, read the file src/README
    for information on how to create a configuration file for your system.

2.  Read and edit src/Makefile to suit your local setup.
    Note that any changes made to src/Makefile will disappear when you
    re-run src/Configure. If you want these changes to be permanent make them
    in src/matrix or src/Makefile.dist. You might want to pass these changes
    to me if they are of general use.

3.  Decide where you want to put the object files of terminal descriptions.
    On my system (and I recommend it for you), the directory /usr/lib/terminfo
    is used.  If your system already has a terminfo database and you want to
    keep separate databases you can put it somewhere else.
    Remember, this is not where the C language source code to the library will
    go; this is where the actual binary terminal descriptions will go.
    You'll need to do these steps (skip these if 
    you're being reasonable or lazy):
	a. Keep in mind that this directory should probably be
	   in your root filesystem so that programs which use terminfo
	   can be used even when the system is only up single-user.
	b. Change the value of the entry for SRCDIR in src/matrix
	   to the name of the directory you've chosen.

4.  Type 'make'.  Ignore any warnings, no error-messages should be produced.
    This should compile the library, the terminfo compiler (tic), and the
    infocmp, clear and tput programs (see the man pages for explanation of
    what they do).

5.  There are several parts to installing ncurses:
	'make install.cmds' installs tic, infocmp, clear and tput.
	'make install.libs' installs the headers and libraries.
	'make install.man' installs the man pages.
	'make install.data' installs the terminfo database. You can skip this
		part if your system already has such a database.
	'make install.all' will do all the above.
	'make alias' will link ncurses.h and nterm.h to curses.h and term.h

6.  Change to the subdirectory test and type 'make all'.  This should compile
    all of the test programs  in the release.  Once again, there should be
    no errors. You'll get lots of warnings, just ignore them. Read the
    file test/README for details on what to expect.

8.  The c++ directory has C++ classes that are built on top of ncurses and
    panels. You need to have installed panels to compile and run the demo.

NOTES:

	If you have SLS or anything based on it (slackware is OK) PLEASE
	remove everything related to ncurses before re-installing it.

	Since most systems already have a curses library, you'll need to
	distinguish between it and ncurses. If ncurses is installed outside
	the standard directories (/usr/include and /usr/lib) then you need
	to use the -I option when you compile programs and -L when you link
	them.

	If you have bsd curses installed in your system and you accidentally
	compile using its curses.h you'll end up with a large number of
	undefined symbols at link time. _waddbytes is one of them.

	The include files will be installed in /usr/include/ncurses.  To 
	arrange for your programs to see them by default, copy them to
	/usr/include from there.
