             How to install Ncurses/Terminfo on your system 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
************************************************************
* READ ALL OF THIS FILE BEFORE YOU TRY TO INSTALL NCURSES. *
************************************************************

You should be reading the file INSTALL in a directory called:
ncurses-d.d.d, where d.d.d is the current version number (see README).
There are several subdirectories, called 'src', 'test', 'data',
and 'man'.

REQUIREMENTS:

You will need the following in order to build and install ncurses under UNIX:

	* ANSI C compiler  (gcc is recommended)
	* sh               (bash will do)
	* awk
	* sed
	* BSD or System V style install

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE:

1.  Run Configure.
    
    Tell it the OS you are using.  It will create your Makefile.
    If your operating system is not supported, read the PORTABILITY section
    in the file src/README for information on how to create a configuration
    file for your system.

2.  Decide where you want to put the object files of terminal descriptions.

    This step may not be necessary if your operating system is
    one of those supported by Configure.

    On my system (and I recommend it for you), the directory /usr/lib/terminfo
    is used.  If your system already has a terminfo database and you want to
    keep separate databases you can put it somewhere else.

    Remember, this is not where the C language source code to the library will
    go; this is where the actual binary terminal descriptions will go.

    To use a non-default location, you'll need to do these steps (skip these
    if you're being reasonable or lazy):

	a. Keep in mind that this directory should probably be
	   in your root filesystem so that programs which use terminfo
	   can be used even when the system is only up single-user.

	b. Change the value of the entry for SRCDIR in src/matrix
	   to the name of the directory you've chosen.

	c. Return to step 1 (running Configure).

2.  Read and (if necessary) edit src/Makefile to suit your local setup.

    This step will probably not be necessary if your operating system is
    one of those supported by Configure.  In this case, the 

    Note that any changes made to src/Makefile will disappear when you
    re-run src/Configure. If you want these changes to be permanent make them
    in src/matrix or src/Makefile.dist. You might want to pass these changes
    to me if they are of general use.

4.  Type 'make'.

    Ignore any warnings, no error-messages should be produced.
    This should compile the library, the terminfo compiler (tic), and the
    infocmp, clear and tput programs (see the man pages for explanation of
    what they do).

5.  There are several parts to installing ncurses once it has compiled:

	'make install.cmds' installs tic, infocmp, captoinfo, clear and tput.
	'make install.libs' installs the headers and libraries.
	'make install.man' installs the man pages.
	'make install.data' installs the terminfo database. You can skip this
		part if your system already has such a database.

	'make install.all' will do all the above.

TESTING:

6.  Change to the subdirectory test and type 'make all'.

    This should compile all of the test programs in the release.  Once again,
    there should be no errors. You'll get lots of warnings, just ignore them.
    Read the file test/README for details on what to expect.

7.  Run ncurses and several other test programs.

    The ncurses program is designed specifically to test the ncurses library.
    You can useit to verify that the screen highlights work correctly, that
    cursor addressing and window scrolling works OK, etc.

NOTES:
	If you have SLS or anything based on it (slackware is OK) PLEASE
	remove everything related to ncurses before re-installing it.

	Since most systems already have a curses library, you'll need to
	distinguish between it and ncurses. If ncurses is installed outside
	the standard directories (/usr/include and /usr/lib) then you need
	to use the -I option when you compile programs and -L when you link
	them.

	If you have BSD curses installed in your system and you accidentally
	compile using its curses.h you'll end up with a large number of
	undefined symbols at link time. _waddbytes is one of them.

	The include files will be installed in /usr/include/ncurses.  To 
	arrange for your programs to see them by default, copy them to
	/usr/include from there.

	On many systems, the make production `install.sys' will install
	ncurses over the system curses libraries.  Don't do this casually!

	The c++ directory has C++ classes that are built on top of ncurses and
	panels.  You need to have installed panels to compile and run the demo.
